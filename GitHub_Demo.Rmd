# Introduction
The purpose of this file is to summarize the tutorial on getting set-up on GitHub in RStudio by David Keyes:
https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r

# Reasons for using GitHub

1. Marketable Skill (that still doesn't answer "why", see below...)
2. Common way to show your code + project work to prospective employers, friends
3. Version Control (tracks prior versions of your code)
4. Group Version Control (collaborate on code with others - it handles the changes for you!)
5. Free AI CoPilot for students

# The Steps

1. Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Configure Git:
  a. install.packages("usethis")
  b. use_git_config(user.name = "Biola Bob", user.email = "biola.bob@biola.edu")
  c. Check it from Terminal with biolabob$ git --version
3. Initialize a Git Repository
  a. use_git()
